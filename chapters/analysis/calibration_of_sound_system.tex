\section{Calibration of sound system}
This section analyses the calibration method, which is used by a selection of some Danish sound company. By experience of the author, the hypothesis is that the sound system is calibrated in one point and the microphone is placed just in front of the \gls{foh}. The \gls{foh} is often a little tent, where the sound engineer controls the sound system. The tent is only open in the direction of the stage and reflection might occur from the tent ceiling to the calibration microphone.
