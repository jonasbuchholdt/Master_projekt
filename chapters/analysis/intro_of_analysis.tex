\section{Live venue sound challenges}
This section explore the challenges of producing sound in an outdoor environmental. The challenge of producing a good sound experience for the audience highly depend on the calibration method and the atmosphere condition. It is well known that acoustically wave propagation is strongly affected by the inhomogeneous atmosphere doing the outdoor sound propagation. This inhomogeneous atmosphere shifts the calibration of the sound system which affect the intelligibility. The following section address the impact of the homogeneous  effect and the inhomogeneous effect on wave propagation.
