\section{Wave propagation in atmospheric conditions change}
The aim of this section is to analyses the sound wave propagation in changing atmospheric conditions. It is well known that the propagation is highly depending on the atmospheric conditions, but the affact is not linear from the low frequency to the high frequency. The attunation difference can be above \dB{80} ?? 



propagation is highly affected by weather change, where the affect of the low frequency is very low.
