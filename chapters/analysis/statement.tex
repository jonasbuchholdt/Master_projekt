Based on the knowledge founded in \autoref{ch:analysis} and the concluction drawn from \autoref{ch:analysis:summary} a problem statement can be made. For the rest of the project the following will be the focus.


\textbf{Is it posible to controle the speaker such that the average \gls{spl} over the speaker corverage area is more homogeneous in cross- and obliquewind condition}



\section{Deimitation}
The following delimitations are made for the rest of the project:

\begin{itemize}
\item It is chosen to work with mono line array setup, since the number of line source array is limited to six. Therefore the stereo problem will not be included in the work/solution.
\item All measurement will be done without audience above mown grass. 
\item Only a solution to the crosswind direction is research. A solution to oblique wind might be founded by more measurement but should be simple to find after the crosswind solution is designed.  
\end{itemize}
