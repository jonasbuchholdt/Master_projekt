Based on the knowledge founded in \autoref{ch:analysis} and the conclusion drawn in \autoref{ch:analysis:summary}, a problem statement is made. For the rest of this theses, the following is the focus.


\textbf{Is it possible to obtain better homogeneous \gls{spl} coverage in the line source array coverage area in inhomogeneous parallel, cross and oblique wind condition}



\section{Delimitation}
The following delimitations are made for the rest of the project:

\begin{itemize}
\item It is chosen to work with mono line source array since the number of line source array element is limited to six pieces.
\item Due to the amount of needed audience to the research, the homogeneous \gls{spl} is searched over mown grass without the audience.
\end{itemize}
