Based on the knowledge founded in \autoref{ch:analysis} and the concluction drawn from \autoref{} a problem statement can be made. For the rest of the project the following will be the focus.


\textbf{Is it possible by signal possessing or physical ajustment with an line source array and an array of wind and temperature sensors to minimise the sound shadow zone created be atmospheric refraction. calculate the max distance before delay tower}

\section{Deimitation}
The following delemitation is made for the search for a solution of atmospheric atmospheric.
