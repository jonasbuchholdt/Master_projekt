The analysis started addressing the general used method for live concert. It is found out that love concert today use line source array system to cover the audience area with sound. It is observed that a line source array is flown above the audience at the main stage and at a large concert delay tower line source array is used and placed in the middle of the audience. It is founded that a line source array is constructed of many identically speaker attached to each other in a vertical line. Based on the speaker set up the distance from every audience to the speaker depends on the position in the concert area. Therefore the distance from the speaker and the audience depends on the audience and therefore the sound system have to be optimized such that the \gls{spl} coverage is equaly in all position. The following analysis in ... founded that a homogenious \gls{spl} among all audience is an imposible senario but the \gls{spl} among all audience might be possible to optimized by knowledge of the condition of the atmosphere and make up for the spredding lose. 


The experence of the author is included as knowledge for the analysis. It is observed by the author that the wind condition at a concert has a large influence of the experience of the concert. At the low frequency the influence is sparse where for high frequency the effect of the atmospherical condition have a big influence especially when the distance from the speaker is increesed. The figh frequency blowes away for periods ad comes back again. 

A short introduction to the stereo sweet spot problem is also discused. It is a hot topic today among some of the large speaker factorys but the solution require heavily amount of speakers and flying tools. 


The analysis of sound from a line source array started by the ideal geometric spreading loss. Here it is founded that the sound propagation of the line source array highly depend on the hight of the source. The line source array propagate differently with respect to frequency. At a surtain hight of the line source array the propagation is a cylendrical propagation until a surtain distance from the sorce where it starts propagating as a espherical source. In the cylendrical propagation the sound filed as defined as near-field while in the spherical propagation the sound field is defined as far field. 

In the non ideal senario the line source array propagate in ether a homogeneous atmospherical condition or in an inhomogeneous atmospherical condition. 


In the homogeneous atmospherical condition it is founded that the temperature, humidity, pressure and wind influence the sound field. The effect of temperature and humidity is close cubled on sound propagation. When the tamperature is high and the and the humidity is low the air have an large high frequency absorbsion whereas when the temperature and humidity both is eather high or low the  absorbsion is much less. The second effect the temperature and humidity have on sound propagation is the speed of sound. The higher the temperature is the higher the sound of speed is. At \SI{0}{\percent} humidity the speed of sound incerasses with approximatli \SI{0.6}{\meter\per\second} for every \si{\celsius} increase. The effect of humidity also effect the speed of sound by increaseing speed of sound by incerasing humidity but the speed incerse is neglible compare to the temperature effect. Thudermore effect of speed difference in sound propagation change the wavelendth and therefore the directivity of the speaker is changed, but the change is minimal. 

The effect of wind seems to have a sparse effect on the sound propagation when and only when the wind is homogeneous. It is founded that the speed of wind effect the speed of sound. if the wind mowes in the direction of the sound propagation the wind speed is and addition to to speed of sound to find the resulting propagation of speed of sound. In the uppesite cace the speed of sound is lowered.
