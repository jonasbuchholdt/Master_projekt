\chapter{Test a guitars frequency area}
A measurement was made to measure the transfer function differences in two point in cross wind.


\section*{Materials and setup}
To measure the transfer function in windy weather, the following materials are used:

\section*{Test procedure}


\begin{enumerate}
\item The materials are set up as in \autoref{fig:ap:position} where the microphone and speaker is connected to the audio interface.
\item 10 sine sweep is performed with a length of \SI{5}{\second} each 
\item  The correlation is calculated for each impulse response to the first impulse response for time alignment.  
\item  
\item 
\item 
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Results}

\plot{plot/measurement_one_one}{The graph shows the first transfer function measurement. The $L_{eq,5}$ \gls{spl} different between the microphones is \dB{5.49} (IR_6)}{fig:ap:mea_one_one}



On  \autoref{fig:appendix:low_E_neck} it is seen that the lowest significant frequency is around \SI{80}{\hertz} and the highest significant frequency is around \SI{400}{\hertz}, when playing the low E note on the guitar, using the neck pickup.
