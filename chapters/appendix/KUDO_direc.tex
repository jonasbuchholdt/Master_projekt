\chapter{The directionality of L-acoustics KUDO}\label{ap:dir_of_kudo}
A measurement was made to measure the directionality of a L-acoustics KUDO.  The goal of this appendix is to measure the polar response and calculate transfer functions of the line source array element in a free field environment with calibrated measuring equipment. During the measurement of the polar response, impulse responses are measured with a specified degree step size all around the speaker. E.g. if the step is one degree, the loudspeaker will be turned 1 degree for every  impulse response measurement, until \SI{360}{\degree} is achieved.


\section*{Materials and setup}
To measure the directionality of the line source element, the following materials are used:

\section*{Test procedure}


\begin{enumerate}
\item The materials are set up as in \autoref{fig:ap:refq_meas_setup_anaco} where the  microphone is connected to the audio interface.
\item The microphone is calibrated
\item The speaker is placed \SI{1.7}{\meter} from the microphone and pointing in the direction of the microphone.
\item	The impulse response is measured for every \SI{5}{\degree}
\item The \dB{-3} step contour is calculated until \dB{-21} and plotted.
\end{enumerate}


\section*{Measurement area}
To be able to measure the windscreen frequency response, the anechoic chamber in Fredrick Bajers vej 7B4, 9220 Aalborg is used. The following \autoref{ap:wind:scr_fre_res_direc_pos} shows a drawing of the area ans the position of the fan and windscreen.

The following \autoref{ap:freq:mes_setup} shows the measurement setup.
