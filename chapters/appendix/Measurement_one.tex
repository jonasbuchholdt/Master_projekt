\chapter{Crosswind effect on line source array}\label{ch:ap:measurement_one}
A measurement is made to measure the transfer function and \gls{spl} differences in two point in the crosswind situation. The used line source array has a horizontal dispersion pattern of \SI{100}{\degree}.  


\section*{Materials and setup}
To measure the transfer function in a crosswind situation, the following materials are used:

\section*{Test procedure}


\begin{enumerate}
\item the microphone is calibrated.
\item The wind direction is measured.
\item The materials are set up as in \autoref{fig:ap:position} where the line source array is placed in crosswind direction, such that the frontal wave direction is orthogonal the wind. The microphone and line source array are connected to the audio interface.
\item The line source array and microphone are placed \SI{1.1}{\meter} above the ground
\item the wind direction goes from microphone 2 to microphone 1.
\item 10 sine sweep is performed with a length of \SI{5}{\second} each. 
\item The impulse response is calculated and filtered with a 4th order highpass filter at \Hz{300} to exclude wind noise.
\item The correlation is calculated for each impulse response to the first impulse response for time alignment \citep{gunness2001loudspeaker} of both microphone channel.
\item The average impulse response is calculated for the 10 measurements of both microphones.
\item The transfer function is calculated with a 40 sample moving mean filter.
\item The measurement is repeated three times.
\item The measurement is repeated with an angle of \SI{74}{\degree} and a distance of \SI{25}{\meter} for both microphone.
\end{enumerate}


\section*{Measurement area}
To be able to measure in a windy area, the football stadium at Fredrick Alfred Nobels Vej 7, 9220 Aalborg is used. The following \autoref{ap:wind:flow_mes_are} shows a picture of the area and the approximate position of the line source array and microphone.

\section*{Results}

The wind speed is \SI{14}{\meter\per\second} for each measurement and the temperature is \SI{5}{\degree}. The humidity is not measured. 

The following measurement shows the result for \SI{120}{\degree}

\plot{plot/measurement_one_one}{The graph shows the first transfer function measurement. The $L_{eq,5}$ \gls{spl} different between the microphones is \dB{5.49} (IR_6)}{fig:ap:mea_one_one}
\plot{plot/measurement_one_two}{The graph shows the second transfer function measurement. The $L_{eq,5}$ \gls{spl} different between the microphones is \dB{4.40} (IR_7)}{fig:ap:mea_one_two}
\plot{plot/measurement_one_three}{The graph shows the third transfer function measurement. The $L_{eq,5}$ \gls{spl} different between the microphones is \dB{4.23} (IR_8)}{fig:ap:mea_one_thr}

On \autoref{fig:ap:mea_one_one}, \autoref{fig:ap:mea_one_two} and \autoref{fig:ap:mea_one_thr} it is seen that the general pressure is higher for microphone 1. It is also seen that ground reflection effect is much higher on microphone 1 than microphone 2. This support the theory about upwards refraction of sound wave on microphone 2 and downwards refraction on microphone 1 

The following measurement shows the result for \SI{74}{\degree}

\plot{plot/measurement_two_one}{The graph shows the first transfer function measurement. The $L_{eq,5}$ \gls{spl} different between the microphones is \dB{4.41} (IR_3)}{fig:ap:mea_two_one}
\plot{plot/measurement_two_two}{The graph shows the second transfer function measurement. The $L_{eq,5}$ \gls{spl} different between the microphones is \dB{4.81} (IR_5)}{fig:ap:mea_two_two}

On \autoref{fig:ap:mea_two_one} and \autoref{fig:ap:mea_two_two} it is seen that the general pressure is higher for microphone 1. It is also seen that ground reflection effect is much higher on microphone 1 than microphone 2.
