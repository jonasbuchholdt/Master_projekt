\chapter{cross wind effect on line source array}\label{ch:ap:measurement_two}
A measurement was made to measure the transfer function differences in two point in cross wind. The used speaker have a horizontal dispersion pattern of \SI{100}{\degree}. 


\section*{Materials and setup}
To measure the transfer function in a cross wind situation, the following materials are used:

\section*{Test procedure}


\begin{enumerate}
\item the microphone i calibrated.
\item The wind direction is measured.
\item The materials are set up as in \autoref{fig:ap:position_b} where the speaker is placed in cross wind direction, such that the frontal wave direction is orthogonal the the wind. The microphone and speaker is connected to the audio interface.
\item The speaker and microphone is placed \SI{1}{\meter} above the ground
\item the wind direction goes from microphone 2 to microphone 1.
\item 10 sine sweep is performed with a length of \SI{5}{\second} each. 
\item The impulse response is calculated and filtered with a 4th order highpass filter at \Hz{300} to exclude wind noise.
\item The correlation is calculated for each impulse response to the first impulse response for time alignment \citep{gunness2001loudspeaker} of both microphone channel.
\item The mean impulse response is calculated for the 10 measurement of both microphone.
\item The transfer function is calculated with a 40 sample moving mean filter.
\item The measurement is repeated two times.
\end{enumerate}


\section*{Results}

The wind speed was \SI{14}{\meter\per\second} for each measurement and the temperature was \SI{5}{\degree}. The humidity was not measured. 

\plot{plot/measurement_two_one}{The graph shows the first transfer function measurement. The $L_{eq,5}$ \gls{spl} different between the microphones is \dB{4.41} (IR_3)}{fig:ap:mea_two_one}
\plot{plot/measurement_two_two}{The graph shows the second transfer function measurement. The $L_{eq,5}$ \gls{spl} different between the microphones is \dB{4.81} (IR_5)}{fig:ap:mea_two_two}

On \autoref{fig:ap:mea_two_one} and \autoref{fig:ap:mea_two_two} it is seen that the general pressure is higher for microphone 1. It is also seen that ground reflection effect is much higher on microphone 1 than microphone 2. This support the theory about upwards refraction of sound wave on microphone 2 and downwards refraction on microphone 1
