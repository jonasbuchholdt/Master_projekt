\chapter{Windscreen attenuation measurement}
A measurement was made to measure the frequency attenuation of difference windscreen configuration. All configuration include the GRAS AM0069 windscreen with an additionally wind stopper surface all around the microphone except of the frontal direction. The measurement is done in the anechoic chamber. The measurement is done to analyse the effect of the windscreen in the frequency domain to ensure that the chosen windscreen do not add to much reflect to the measurement. The optimal criteria is therefore as low difference as possible. 




\section*{Materials and setup}
To measure the frequency response of the windscreen configuration the following materials are used:

\section*{Test procedure}


\begin{enumerate}
\item The materials are set up as in \autoref{fig:ap:refq_meas_setup} where the  microphone is connected to the audio interface.
\item The microphone is calibrated
\item The speaker is placed \SI{3}{\meter} from the microphone and pointing in the direction of the microphone.
\item	The windscreen configuration is placed such that the microphone have approximately the same position as without the windscreen.
\item The transfer function is measured 
\item The procedure is started over until all windscreen is measured.
\item The transfer function is calculated and plotted versus the transfer function without windscreen \matlab.
\item The difference between the transfer function wit and without windscreen is calculated and plotted in \matlab.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Summary}

It is seen in the graph that all windscreen configuration change the frequency response of the microphone, even with only the original windscreen. Without taking the reference configuration intro account, the one with the lowest frequency change in the low frequency response is configuration one and four. The one with the lowest frequency change in the middle frequency is configuration one and two. The one with lowest frequency change in the high frequency is configuration four. The mix between configuration two and four shows a low frequency change in the middle and high frequency.
