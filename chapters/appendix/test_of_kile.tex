\chapter{Windscreen concept measurement}
A measurement was made to measure the wind attenuation of difference windscreen configuration. All configuration include the GRAS AM0069 windscreen with an additionally wind stopper surface all around the microphone except of the frontal direction. The measurement is done as a preliminary test with low wind speed, to test the concept before a field test with wind speed as in the speaker measurement. The measurement is done to ensure that the measured wind does not overload the preamp of the microphone at the specified wind speed.  


\section*{Materials and setup}
To measure the wind attenuation of the windscreen configuration the following materials are used:

\section*{Test procedure}


\begin{enumerate}
\item The materials are set up as in \autoref{fig:ap:wind_meas_setup} where the two microphone connected to the audio interface.
\item Both microphone is calibrated.
\item Both fan is activated 
\item A \SI{7}{\second} time signal is measured three times synchronise on both microphone.
\item The frequency content is calculated by \texttt{fft} on all six measured time signal.
\item The average of the frequency response for each microphone is calculated
\item The difference between the microphone is calculated to find the attenuation of the windscreen configuration
\item The procedure is done for all windscreen configuration and one where no additionally wind stopper is added around the microphone. This last configuration is defined as reference configuration.
\item A no wind measurement is measured the same way just without the fan activated and only with GRAS AM0069 windscreen in the end.
\item The wind speed is measured.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Results}

The following graphs shows the result of the measurement. The wind speed is measured to be \SI{2.5}{\meter\per\second}.

The \autoref{fig:ap:att_wit_bal_no_vin} shows the frequency content in the measuring area without the fan activated for both microphone and the reference windscreen configuration.

The \autoref{fig:ap:att_wit_bal_an_vin} shows the frequency content in the measuring area with the fan activated for both microphone and the reference windscreen configuration. It is seen that the highest attenuation is at \Hz{900} but the general attenuation is

The \autoref{fig:ap:att_wit_bal_sma_kil} and \autoref{fig:ap:tim_wit_bal_sma_kil} shows the measurement with configuration one in frequency and time domain respectively. It can be seen that the general windscreen attenuation is not lowered compared to the reference windscreen measurement.

The measurement shows that the windscreen attenuation does have an effect compare to the reference windscreen measurement. The attenuation is nearly greater for all frequency especially in the low and high frequency range.

The measurement shows that the windscreen attenuation does have an effect compare to the reference windscreen measurement but the attenuation is not as good as in configuration two. There is better attenuation is the low frequency compare to the reference windscreen measurement but in the high frequency the attenuation i worse than the reference windscreen measurement, that might be bue to reflection on the surface of the rockwool filt.


\section*{Summary}
It is shown that the additionally wind stopper hypotheses does attenuate the wind noise at a wind speed of \SI{2.5}{\meter\per\second}
