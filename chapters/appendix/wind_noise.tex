\chapter{cross wind effect on line source array}\label{ch:ap:measurement_one}
A measurement was made to measure the transfer function differences in two point in cross wind. The used speaker have a horizontal dispersion pattern of \SI{100}{\degree}. 


\section*{Materials and setup}
To measure the transfer function in a cross wind situation, the following materials are used:

\section*{Test procedure}


\begin{enumerate}
\item the microphone i calibrated.
\item The wind direction is measured.
\item The materials are set up as in \autoref{fig:ap:position_wind_noise}.
\item The windscreen with microphone is placed \SI{1.6}{\meter} above the ground
\item The windscreen is situated such that the screen is orthogonal to the wind.
\item A time slot of \SI{7}{\second} audio is measured 10 times.
\item The measurement is repeated while the windscreen is rotated $\pm$ \SI{30}{\degree}
\item Afterwards all measurement is done over where the windscreen is situated on the ground.
\item In the end the noise is measured without the windscreen but with the original modified windscreen in both hight. 
\end{enumerate}


\section*{Measurement area}
To be able to measure in a windy area, the football stadium at Fredrick Alfred Nobels Vej 7, 9220 Aalborg is used. The following \autoref{ap:wind:flow_mes_are} shows a picture of the area and the approximate position of the speaker and microphone.

\section*{Results}

The wind speed was \SI{10}{\meter\per\second} for each measurement.
