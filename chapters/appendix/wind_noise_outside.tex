\chapter{Wind noise attenuation of the designed windscreen}\label{ap:wind_noise_in_design}
A measurement is made to measure the wind noise attenuation of the designed windscreen. All measurement include the modified GRAS AM0069 windscreen. The measurement is done in a real scenario outside on a flat area with high wind speed than \SI{5}{\meter\per\second}. The measurement is done to ensure that the measured wind noise does not overload the preamp of the microphone at the measured wind speed.  


\section*{Materials and setup}
To measure the wind attenuation of the windscreen configuration the following materials are used:

\section*{Test procedure}


\begin{enumerate}
\item The materials are set up as in \autoref{fig:ap:win_noi_out_set} where the microphone is connected to the audio interface.
\item The microphone is calibrated.
\item A \SI{7}{\second} time signal is measured.
\item The frequency content is calculated by \texttt{fft} after a Hanning window windows the time signal.
\item The procedure is done with, and without the windscreen
\item The procedure is done where the windscreen is rotated \SI{50}{\degree} and \SI{-50}{\degree}
\item The result is plotted in \matlab
\item The measurement is done over for every position until similar wind speed is measured with about \SI{8.5}{\meter\per\second}
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Measurement area}
To be able to measure in a windy area, the football stadium at Fredrick Alfred Nobels Vej 7, 9220 Aalborg is used. The following \autoref{ap:wind:flow_mes_are_des} shows a picture of the area and the approximate position of the microphone.

\section*{Results}

The following graphs show the result of the measurement. 



The graph in \autoref{fig:ap:windnoise_without_screen} shows a measurement where the modified original windscreen is on the ground and in the hight of \SI{1.7}{\meter}. 
\plot{plot/windnoise_without_screen}{The graph shows the frequency content of the measurement without the windscreen}{fig:ap:windnoise_without_screen}
As seen in \autoref{fig:ap:windnoise_without_screen}, the wind noise is more than \dB{10} lower while the modified original windscreen is moved from the hight of \SI{1.7}{\meter} to the ground. 



The graph in \autoref{fig:ap:windnoise_with_screen} shows a measurement where the designed windscreen is on the ground and in the hight of \SI{1.7}{\meter}. The windscreen is \SI{90}{\degree} to the wind in both measurements, which mean that the wind is orthogonal to the middle of the white PVC plate. 
\plot{plot/windnoise_with_screen}{The graph shows the frequency content of the measurement without the windscreen}{fig:ap:windnoise_with_screen}
As in \autoref{fig:ap:windnoise_without_screen} The wind noise is lowered more that  \dB{10} in \autoref{fig:ap:windnoise_with_screen}. Furthermore, the wind noise is lowered approximately \dB{5} to \dB{10} from \Hz{100} and below while the designed windscreen is used. The highest attenuation is while the windscreen is lifted above the ground.

Based on the observed ground reflection shown in \autoref{sec:des:ground_reflection} and the large noise differences founded in the above measurement, only the measurement on the ground is shown in the rest of the measurement. The measurement in ear height is chosen to be irrelevant since the measurement for the final test is done with a microphone on the ground. The measurement in the hight of the ear can be founded in the file. The following measurement \autoref{fig:ap:windnoise_with_screen_on_ground} shows the measurement with and without the designed windscreen. 


\plot{plot/windnoise_with_screen_on_ground}{The graph shows the frequency content of the measurement without the windscreen}{fig:ap:windnoise_with_screen_on_ground}
As it is seen in \autoref{fig:ap:windnoise_with_screen_on_ground} and explained above, it is clearly seen that the designed windscreen attenuate the wind noise. The next measurement \autoref{fig:ap:windnoise_with_screen_rotation} shows the differences in wind noise while the windscreen is ether rotated \SI{50}{\degree} to the left and to the right.  

\plot{plot/windnoise_with_screen_rotation}{The graph shows the frequency content of the measurement without the windscreen}{fig:ap:windnoise_with_screen_rotation}
As seen in \autoref{fig:ap:windnoise_with_screen_rotation}, the wind noise depends on the angle of the wind to the designed windscreen. While the designed windscreen is rotated \SI{50}{\degree} to the left, the windscreen does not have any wind noise attenuation compared to the measurement with only the modified windscreen. While the designed windscreen is rotated \SI{50}{\degree} to the right, the wind noise follows the wind noise while the designed windscreen is not rotated unless around \Hz{2} where the noise is \dB{10} higher.   \\



All measurement for wind noise is founded in the file under 'measurement/wind_noise/'. The measurement is stored in the given mat file and 

'show_test_result.m' calculate the result.
