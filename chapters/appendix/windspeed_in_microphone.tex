\chapter{Windscreen wind speed measurement}\label{ap:wind_speed_att_first}
A measurement is made to measure the wind attenuation in the microphone position with the difference windscreen configuration.


\section*{Materials and setup}
To measure the wind attenuation of the windscreen configuration the following materials are used:

\section*{Test procedure}


\begin{enumerate}
\item The materials are set up as in \autoref{fig:ap:wind_meas_setup_mic}.
\item The fan is placed such that is produce directly crosswind.
\item The fan is activated 
\item The anemometer is activated to record.
\item The anemometer is placed in the wind for approximately \SI{10}{\second}.
\item Then the anemometer is moved into the microphone position for approximately \SI{10}{\second}.
\item Then the anemometer is moved back in the wind for approximately \SI{10}{\second}.
\item Then the anemometer is moved into the microphone position for approximately \SI{10}{\second} again. 
\item The wind speed measurement is plotted in \matlab with a moving mean filter with two samples and as \si{\meter\per\second} versus \si{\second}.
\item Next the wind direction measurement is plotted in \matlab with a moving mean filter with two samples and as \si{\degree} versus \si{\second}.
\item The measurement is done for all windscreen configuration the same way.
\end{enumerate}

The following \autoref{ap:wind:anemometer} shows the anemometer used for the measurement.

\section*{Measurement area}
To be able to generate a controlled wind flow, the hallway in Fredrick Bajers vej 7B5, 9220 Aalborg is used. The following \autoref{ap:wind:flow_slow} shows a drawing of the area and the position of the fan and windscreen.

\section*{Results}

The following graphs show the result of the measurement.

\autoref{ap:wind:small} shows the measurement setup of the foam wedge, where the \autoref{fig:ap:wind_small} shows the result.
