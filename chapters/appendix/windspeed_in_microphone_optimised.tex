\chapter{Windscreen wind noise attenuation measurement}
A measurement is made to measure the wind attenuation in the microphone position with the difference windscreen configuration.


\section*{Materials and setup}
To measure the wind attenuation of the windscreen configuration the following materials are used:

\section*{Test procedure}


\begin{enumerate}
\item The materials are set up as in \autoref{fig:ap:wind_meas_setup_opt}.
\item The fan is placed such that is produce directly crosswind.
\item The fan is activated 
\item The anemometer is activated to record.
\item The anemometer is placed in the wind for approximately \SI{10}{\second}.
\item Then the anemometer is moved into the microphone position for approximately \SI{10}{\second}.
\item Then the anemometer is moved back in the wind for approximately \SI{10}{\second}.
\item Then the anemometer is moved into the microphone position for approximately \SI{10}{\second} again. 
\item The wind speed measurement is plotted in \matlab with a moving mean filter with two samples and as \si{\meter\per\second} versus \si{\second}.
\item Next the wind direction measurement is plotted in \matlab with a moving mean filter with two samples and as \si{\degree} versus \si{\second}.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Measurement area}
To be able to generate a controlled wind flow, the hallway in Fredrick Bajers vej 7B5, 9220 Aalborg is used. The following \autoref{ap:wind:flow_opt} shows a drawing of the area and the position of the fan and windscreen.

\section*{Results}

The following graphs show the result of the measurement.

\autoref{ap:wind:small} shows the measurement setup of the foam wedge, where the \autoref{fig:ap:wind_larg_opt} shows the result.

\plot{plot/wind_large_optimised}{The graph shows the wind speed versus time for the optimised configuration five. The grape have a high speed period and a low speed period. In the high speed period, the anemometer is in the wind approximately \SI{30}{\centi\meter} from the windscreen where in the low speed period, the anemometer is inside the windscreen.}{fig:ap:wind_larg_opt}
\plot{plot/wind_large_optimised_direction}{The graph shows the synchronous direction of the wind with respect the the wind speed in \autoref{fig:ap:wind_larg_opt}.}{fig:ap:wind_large__opt_dir}
It is seen in \autoref{fig:ap:wind_larg_opt} that the wind speed is lowered from approximately \SI{8}{\meter\per\second} to \SI{0.5}{\meter\per\second}. It is seen in \autoref{fig:ap:wind_large__opt_dir} that the windscreen produces turbulence in the windscreen and the direction of the wind change approximately \SI{-100}{\degree}. The reason that the angle is negative in this measurement is that the anemometer is turned \SI{180}{\degree} in the vertical plan for practical reason.
