\section{Test of measuring design}\label{sec:ds:test_of_mes_des}
This section aims to test the design measurement in a windy day, to outsource problem and error in the measuring design. The test is done in full scale with all six line source array element and in the designed hight. The test is intended to both test the crosswind measuring design and the parallel wind measuring design, but the wind condition only allowed for crosswind test. After the crosswind measuring design was tested the wind speed dropped to beneath \SI{1}{\meter\per\second}.
In the crosswind measuring design, three problems and one code error are observed. The code error is a data save bug, where only the direction of the wind at the speaker tower is saved. The wind direction at the microphone position is not saved doing the test measurement. The code bug is fixed for the final measurement. The following three \autoref{sec:des:ground_reflection}, \autoref{sec:des:freq_boost} and \autoref{sec:des:measuring_angle} explain the observed difficulties or design failure and propose a solution to them. 
The first difficulty which is discovered is major ground reflections in the measurement. The second problem seems to be frequency response differences of the designed windscreen, where the third error is the angle of the line source array while measuring in the hight of the ear.  
The explanations is based on the measurement as seen in \autoref{fig:td:mea_1_0_deg} which shows the frequency response on all three microphones at \SI{0}{\degree} rotation.

\plot{plot/measuring_1_0_deg}{The graph shows the frequency response for all three microphone while the speaker is not rotated}{fig:td:mea_1_0_deg}

All three microphone measurement in \autoref{fig:td:mea_1_0_deg} is the mean of 10 measurement. The mean is calculated in time domain by aligning the impulse response with help of cross correlation. The wind speed and wind direction is also the mean of the 10 measurement. 

To be able to differentiate between the microphone in the explanation, the microphone is named according to the position and the wind direction. In the upwards refraction direction, the microphone is named upwards microphone, in the downwards refraction direction the microphone is named downwards microphone, and the center microphone is named center microphone. The following \autoref{fig:ds:position} illustrate the microphone position verses the wind direction.

\xfig{design/measurement_one_KUDO.pdf_t}{The figure shows the microphone position versus the position of the line source, while the array is \SI{0}{\degree} horizontal turned}{fig:ds:position_test}{1}

As seen in \autoref{fig:ds:position_test}, the position of the anemometer temperature and humidity sensor is also given at its position doing the measurement. To ensure that the measurement is a measure of the transfer function and not the wind noise, a \gls{spl} headroom is measured as the first part. The headroom is measured in to ways, one where the wind noise is measured and one where transfer function is measured at high \gls{spl} level whereafter the output level to the speaker is lowered by \dB{10} and the transfer function is measured again. While the frequency response in the hole frequency range is lowered by \dB{10} the headroom is at less \dB{10}. The noise floor is founded to be pink noise with \dB{70} as its maximum at \Hz{2} at all microphone position and with a wind speed of \SI{5}{\meter\per\second}. All measurement is done with sine sweep with constant amplitude and with a headroom of more than \dB{10}. The headroom measurement was visually checked by plotting the measuring result in \matlab. The headroom measuring check is not saved as a file in this measurement but will saved and shown in the final measurement.



\subsection{Ground reflections}\label{sec:des:ground_reflection}
One intended outcome of the windscreen is to block for the ground reflection by the circular wood plate, such that the measuring position can be in the hight of the ear as explained in \autoref{}. This part of the windscreen fails in fully blockage all ground reflections, and as the frequency grows the effect seems to be worse since higher peaks and depth are present in the measurement compare to the directionality measurement of the speaker in \autoref{fig:ap:KUDO_25_55_des}. The centre microphone does not have that high peaks and deeps, but the upwards and downwards microphone seems to suffer from ground reflection in the high frequency, which makes the refraction comparison between the microphone position difficult. One thing that might cause the reflection is the position different from \SI{0}{\degree} vertical of the windscreen in the air to the ground. If the plate is tilted forward, there might be some reflection reaching the microphone. A calculation of the reflection might have helped to justify the ground reflection theory, but since the source is a line source array and not a point source the ground reflection is not as easy to calculate since there might be thousands of sound path from the line source to the microphone. The following \autoref{fig:td:gro_ref_ilu} illustrate the path calculation difficulties and the forward tilting of the windscreen. 

\xfig{design/ground_reflection.pdf_t}{The figure shows an illustration of the measured setup and some soundpath}{fig:td:gro_ref_ilu}{1}  


To be able to make a qualified considering to decide if the peaks and depth are due to ground reflection, the measurement is compared to a measurement where the microphone windscreen is situated on the ground and the frequency characteristics in the measuring direction in \autoref{fig:ap:KUDO_25_55_des}.  It have to be noted that the speaker mount, mounted on the windscreen lift the center of the designed windscreen such that the windscreen cannot lay flat on the ground but is tilted forward. The windscreen was tilted forward by \SI{8}{\degree} doing all measurement on the ground in all microphone position. The following \autoref{fig:td:mea_1_0_deg_down} shows a frequency response on at all three microphones position of the line source array, where the windscreen is placed on the ground and with a non-rotation line source array.

\plot{plot/measuring_1_0_deg_down}{The graph shows the measuring result along all three microphone, while the microphone is in the windscreen and the windscreen is on the ground. The graph is a mean of three measurement for the upwards and downwards microphone and one measurement for the center position. The mean calculation is done in time domain where the all impulse responses is allined with cross-correlation}{fig:td:mea_1_0_deg_down}

The frequency depth seen at \Hz{3700} in the downwards direction is due to the directionality characteristics of the line source array and can also be seen in \autoref{fig:ap:KUDO_25_55_des}. The same applies to \Hz{9200} and \SI{10}{\kilo\hertz}

Comparing the measurement where the windscreen is lifted \SI{168}{\centi\meter} from the ground in \autoref{fig:td:mea_1_0_deg} and the measurement in \autoref{fig:td:mea_1_0_deg_down}, it is seen that the first ground reflection comes around \Hz{250} depending on the microphone. This ground reflection is \db wise even for all microphone position and might, therefore, be due to sound wave travels through the windscreen bottom plate. The following arriving ground reflection depends highly on the microphone position and then might be due to the vertical angle of the designed windscreen. For the upwards refraction microphone, there seems to be highly reflections in the frequency area from \Hz{5500} to \Hz{9500} where comb filtering is present. Comparing the line source frequency characteristics, it also shows depth in that frequency range, but as high depth as present in the measurement. The measurement has more that \dB{15} attenuation where the line source frequency characteristics only have \dB{6} attenuation.

Another common response on all microphone while the windscreen lays on the ground is depth around \SI{10}{\kilo\hertz}. This depth might be due to the lift of the microphone while it is within the modified original windscreen or that the windscreen is tilted forward and does not lay flat on the ground. 

Based on the founding in the measurement, ground reflection occur in the measurement.


\subsection{Frequency boost}\label{sec:des:freq_boost}
Doing the measurement a frequency boost between \Hz{2000} and \SI{10}{\kilo\hertz} is observed and will be researched in this section. The frequency boost is observed while the microphone is laying on the ground whit and without the windscreen. Furthermore the wind doing the measurement is less than \SI{1}{\meter\per\second} and therefore refraction is not present at a distance of \SI{50}{\meter}. A comparison measurement is done, where the windscreen is removed from the centre microphone since the wind stopped at the end of the measurement. The following \autoref{fig:td:mea_1_0_deg_boost} shows the measurement result for all three microphones with windscreen and one measurement where the windscreen is removed from the centre microphone. The original modified windscreen covering the microphone is also removed. 

\plot{plot/measuring_1_0_deg_boost}{The graph shows the measuring result along all three microphone, where one of the measurement for the center microphone is done with designed windscreen setup and one measurement is done without the design windscreen setup but with the modified original windscreen. While the microphone is in the designed windscreen, the designed windscreen is on the ground. While the microphone is outside the design windscreen, the microphone lays on a wood plate with same size as the designed windscreen.  The graph is a mean of three measurement for the upwards and downwards microphone and one measurement for the center position for both center measurement. The mean calculation is done in time domain where the all impulse responses is allined with cross-correlation}{fig:td:mea_1_0_deg_boost}

It is seen in \autoref{fig:td:mea_1_0_deg_boost} that the depth at \SI{10}{\kilo\hertz} is gone for the center microphone without any windscreen, but ether a \dB{20} attenuation of the center microphone or a \dB{20} amplification while the microphone is within the designed windscreen. The amplification or attenuation is not a problem in itself, the arising problem is that the amplification is not even along the microphone position. The measurement is done with less than \SI{1}{\meter\per\second} of wind speed, and therefore refraction can be excluded as a factor of differences. This means that differences on the windscreen setup might influences on the frequency response. 
Three mechanical differences are observed on the windscreen setup doing the measurement. The first is the vertical angle of the windscreen, which was different along all designed windscreens doing the measurement because the ground was uneven. The ground unevenness was measured afterwards to be upto \SI{8}{\degree}. Secondly, the rotational angle of the designed windscreen was also different along with all designed windscreen. The rotational angle is defined to be \SI{0}{\degree} to the line source array while the line source array points directly into the centre of the windscreen opening as shown in \autoref{fig:td:win_poi_dir}.

\xfig{design/windscreen_point_direction.pdf_t}{The figure shows an illustration the windscreen vertical \SI{0}{\degree} angle}{fig:td:win_poi_dir}{1}  

As illustrated in \autoref{fig:td:win_poi_dir} no matter the tournament of the speaker, the opening shall point directly to the speaker. In the measurement the opening was not pointing directly to the speaker as shown in \autoref{fig:td:win_poi_dir}, The vertical angle was adjusted with depends on the wind, witch mean that the windscreen at downwards direction was turned left, where the windscreen at upwards direction was turned right. 

The last differences were the placement of the foam on the plate. In the downwards direction the foam was placed more inwards to the center of the plate while the foam on the other two designed windscreen was placed as shown in \autoref{fig:td:win_poi_dir}


\subsection{Speaker angle}\label{sec:des:measuring_angle}
The angle of the line source array was calculated based on the ground and not from the hight of the microphone hight. The following \autoref{fig:td:mic_pos_cal_err} shows the microphone positions.

\xfig{design/mic_pos_cal_error.pdf_t}{The figure shows the microphone position doing the calculation of the line source array tilting and the measurement}{fig:td:mic_pos_cal_err}{1}  


While using the tilt angle doing the measurement, which was \SI{5}{\degree}, the highest hight before the microphone exit above the nearfield of the line source array coverage main lobe is calculated to be \SI{62}{\centi\meter}. Therefore, since the microphone was placed \SI{1.68}{\meter} above the ground the microphone is fare above the nearfield main lobe. Comparing the \autoref{fig:td:mea_1_0_deg} and \autoref{fig:td:mea_1_0_deg_down} it is clearly seen that the microphone was outside the nearfield main lobe of the high frequency. Above \Hz{2000} the \gls{spl} is more than \dB{10} lower in the ear measuring hight compare to the ground position with the same distances to the speaker. 

\subsection{Measuring result}\label{sec:des:measuring_result}
While all error and difficulties are described and disturb the measurement, the measurement indicates that raising the power in the main lobe also raising the power in the shadow zone. Comparing the microphone against each other is difficult since the differences in the boost between the microphone as described in \autoref{sec:des:freq_boost}. Therefore, to extract useful data, the frequency response on the same microphone is compared for \SI{0}{\degree} of tournament, \SI{10}{\degree} of tournament and \SI{20}{\degree} of tournament.   
The first microphone which is compared is the microphone in the upwards direction. The following \autoref{fig:td:mea_1_0_20_deg_up} shows the frequency response for every tournament.

\plot{plot/measuring_1_0_20_upwards}{The graph shows the measuring result for the upwards microphone in three speaker angle, while the microphone is in the windscreen and the windscreen is in the hight of the ear. The graph is a mean of 10 measurement in all three angle. The mean calculation is done in time domain where the all impulse responses is allined with cross-correlation}{fig:td:mea_1_0_20_deg_up}

As seen in \autoref{fig:td:mea_1_0_20_deg_up}, while the speaker is turned towards the upwards microphone, the \gls{spl} is raised. The peaks and depth are not at the same frequency which makes the visually evaluation difficult, but it visually shows that turning the speaker raises the \gls{spl} in some frequency area especially above \Hz{1000}. The following \autoref{ta:ana:spl_weight_upwards} shows the single number \gls{spl} both non weighted and A-weighted.

%A 0 deg = 56.9073, 10 deg = 58.2032, 20 deg = 60.2822

The second microphone which is compared is the microphone in the downwards direction. The following \autoref{fig:td:mea_1_0_20_deg_down} shows the frequency response for every tournament.


\plot{plot/measuring_1_0_20_downwards}{The graph shows the measuring result for the downwards microphone in three speaker angle, while the microphone is in the windscreen and the windscreen is in the hight of the ear.

As seen in \autoref{fig:td:mea_1_0_20_deg_down}, while the speaker is turned, the \gls{spl} is lowered unless the \SI{20}{\degree} above \Hz{2500}. The raise in power comes from the directionality characteristics of the line source array as seen in \autoref{fig:ap:KUDO_25_55_des}. The peaks and depth is ether not at the same frequency which make the visually justment difficult but it is observed i generally that turning the speaker lower the \gls{spl} from \SI{0}{\degree} to \SI{10}{\degree} above \Hz{650}.

%A 0 deg = 57.2538, 10 deg = 54.5998, 20 deg = 57.3711

The third microphone which is compared is the microphone in the center direction. The following \autoref{fig:td:mea_1_0_20_deg_center} shows the frequency response for every tournament.

\plot{plot/measuring_1_0_20_center}{The graph shows the measuring result for the center microphone in three speaker angle, while the microphone is in the windscreen and the windscreen is in the hight of the ear.

As seen in \autoref{fig:td:mea_1_0_20_deg_center}, the frequency response does not ether raise or fall markebly while the speaker is turned. The large depth between \Hz{2000} and \Hz{5000} comes from the frequency characteristic of the line source array as seen in \autoref{fig:ap:KUDO_25_55_des}.

\section{research the problems}
To be able to decide the last few detail of the final measurement based on the test and data analysis preformed in \autoref{sec:ds:test_of_mes_des}, the frequency response of the designed windscreen is founded in free field condition. Secondly, the wind attenuation of the designed windscreen is measured in similar condition to the final measurement and finally the windscreen microphone hight have to be decided. In \autoref{sec:ds:wind_freq_res} the frequency response of the windscreen is founded where the windscreen is rotated and tilted. In \autoref{sec:ds:wind_noi_att} the wind noise attenuation is measured with different configuration 

\subsection{windscreen frequency response}\label{sec:ds:wind_freq_res}
This section aims to research the frequency response of the designed windscreen. It is observed in \autoref{sec:des:freq_boost} that the measurement with the original windscreen have a boost between \Hz{1000} and \SI{10}{\kilo\hertz} compare to one measurement without the designed windscreen. Therefore it have to be founded if the windscreen by itself makes high \gls{spl} boost in that frequency range or if the differences is an effect of other sources. To ensure that the windscreen does not have such boost in the measured positions, the windscreen is measured in the anechoic chamber both with tilting and with rotation to research the effect of differences of the windscreen. The measurement is founded in \autoref{app:wind_inf_res}. It is observed in the measurement that the windscreen does not have a boost as observed in the measurement in \autoref{sec:des:freq_boost}. The windscreen does have a very small boost of \dB{2} beneeth \Hz{1000} and above \Hz{4000} but not in the same level as the measurement in \autoref{sec:des:freq_boost}. Furthermore small forward tilting upto \SI{9}{\degree} only have an attenuation effect above \SI{10}{\kilo\hertz} due to plate reflection. A rotation of \SI{30}{\degree} ether to the left of to the right does attenuate in the frequency range of \Hz{1000} to \Hz{4000}. The frequency response of the windscreen is also measured while removing the foam wedge but in this configuration many and high reflection occur and is not an option. generality the designed windscreen only change the frequency response upto \dB{2} while the designed windscreen points with \SI{0}{\degree} to the line source array and is non tilted. The following measurement \autoref{fig:ap:freq_resp_with_foa_til_0_rot_0_dt} shows the different while the the microphone only is equired with the original modified windscreen and with the designed windscreen
\plot{plot/windscreen_with_foam_tilt_0_rot_0_dt}{The graph shows frequency response of the speaker measured without windscreen and with the designed windscreen with no rotation and no tilting}{fig:ap:freq_resp_with_foa_til_0_rot_0_dt}



\subsection{windscreen wind noise attenuation}\label{sec:ds:wind_noi_att}
This section aims to research the wind noise in the windscreen to ensure that the wind noise in real condition does not overload the microphone. The measurement is done both with and without the designed windscreen to decide if the windscreen works in the real senario with high speed and directionallity changing wind. The measurement is furthermore done both in the ear hight and on the ground to research is one position have better signal to noise condition in the final measurement. The first preformed measurement is two measurement, one in the ear hight and one on the ground. Both measurement is preformed with the designed windscreen. The measurement is done in the same vertical position where the stand is removed and therefore the measurement is not done in parallel. The measurement is done 10 times on each position, such that to measurement with nearly the same wind speed can be compared. The windscreen is placed \SI{90}{\degree} agenst the wind, which means that the windscreen is placed in its optimal position where the wind blows directly onto the wide PVC plate. The following \autoref{fig:dt:windnoise_with_screen} shows the result.

\plot{plot/windnoise_with_screen_dt}{The graph shows the frequency content of the measurement with the windscreen in the hight of the ear and on the ground}{fig:dt:windnoise_with_screen}

As it is seen in \autoref{fig:dt:windnoise_with_screen}, the wind noise highly depends on the hight of the windscreen position. By lowering the windscreen from the ear hight done to the ground surface, the wind noise is lowered with approximately \dB{20} in the low frequency, which is the frequency area where the wind noise is highest. Furthermore it is research if the designed windscreen have hgiher wind noise attenuation compare to only the modified original windscreen. The following \autoref{fig:dt:windnoise_compare} shows the result.
 
\plot{plot/windnoise_compare}{The graph shows the frequency content of the measurement with and without the windscreen}{fig:dt:windnoise_compare}

As seen in \autoref{fig:dt:windnoise_compare}, the windscreen have generally a \dB{5} to \dB{10} wind noise attenuation. The measurement description is founded in \autoref{ap:wind_noise_in_design}. The measurement description also shows noise measurement of the windscreen where the windscreen is rotated both to the left and to the right. 

\section{Update to the final measurement}
In the final measurement, the designed windscreen is used as it is designed. It is founded that the windscreen does not have any boost in the high frequency and small differences in position makes no difference. It is founded that high tilting and high rotation does have an effect of the frequency response and shall be avoided to the final measurement. It is furthermore decided that the ground reflection shall be minimised as much as possible, such that it might be possible to compare between microphone. In the end the differences between the speaker charatestics with asymmetric makes is diffecult to compare the side microphone since the high degree shows a boost in the higher frequency, as seen is \autoref{fig:ap:KUDO_25_55_des}. Therefore the following points describe the update to the final measurement.


\begin{requirement}\label{req:groundreflection}
    \requirement{The windscreen is possitioned at the ground surface hight and not in the ear hight.}
    \argument{This requirement is made according to the founded ground reflection in \autoref{sec:des:ground_reflection} and that the ground reflection shall be minimised such that the microphone might be able be compared among each other. Secondly is is founded that the wind noise is upto \dB{20} lower near the ground \autoref{sec:ds:wind_noi_att}. finally it is assumed in \autoref{} that the reflection is low while the area is full of audience which support that the ground reflection have to be minimised in the measuring point.}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}\label{req:windscreen}
    \requirement{The windscreen shall lay flat on the ground without tilting higher than \SI{6}{\degree} and point \SI{0}{\degree} to the line source array}
    \argument{This requirement is made according to the founded frequency response change in \autoref{sec:ds:wind_freq_res} while the windscreen is tilted and rotated.}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}\label{req:speakerangle}
    \requirement{The angle of the speaker shall be \SI{3.5}{\degree} downwards}
    \argument{This requirement is made according to the founded ground reflection in \autoref{sec:des:ground_reflection}, such that it is the lower speaker which have the direct sound path, and therefore ground reflection is minimised}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}\label{req:speaker_directionality}
    \requirement{The speaker shall have symmetric directionality charatestic with beamwidth of \SI{50}{\degree}}
    \argument{This requirement is made according to the founded in the measuring result \autoref{sec:des:measuring_result}, where the differences in directionality charastics makes it difficult to compare since the carateristic have a \gls{spl} boost in the \SI{55}{\degree} directionality with an angle of \SI{40}{\degree}}
\end{requirement}
