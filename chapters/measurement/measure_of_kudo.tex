\section{The measurement}
The aim of this section is to show the measuring result from the final measurement, then try to find a relation between the wind direction, the wind speed and the angle of the line source array. The first section \autoref{mes:kudo:cross_mes} covers the measurement done in crosswind. The second section \autoref{mes:kudo:par_mes} covers the measurement done in parallel wind. The third section \autoref{mes:kudo:relaton} analyses the relation between the wind direction, the wind speed and the angle of the line source array.
