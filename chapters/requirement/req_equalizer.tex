\reqPrefix{EQ}
\section{Equalizer (\reqPrefixName)}
Based on \autoref{sec:equalizing}, the following requirements are made for the equalizer:

\begin{requirement}\label{req:equalizer}
    \requirement{The gain of each individual band in the equalizer must be changeable by the user.}
    \argument{In order to give the user the possibility of equalizing the sound as wanted.}
\end{requirement}

\begin{requirement}\label{req:equalizer2}
    \requirement{Each band in the equalizer must, when fully amplified or fully attenuated, drop \SI{6}{\decibel} at the neighbouring bands center frequencies.}
    \argument{In order to make each band independent so the user can change one frequency area, without affecting the others.}
\end{requirement}
